### Overview

The project involves analyzing marathon race data, focusing on various metrics such as race day, race name, race length, number of finishers, athlete information (ID, gender, age), and performance statistics.

### Data Preparation

The notebook includes steps to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.

### Key Analyses

#### Descriptive Statistics

The notebook provides summary statistics for the key variables. This helps in understanding the central tendencies and distributions of different features.

#### Visualizations

Several plots are used to visualize the data:

- Histograms for distribution of athlete ages and performance metrics.
- Boxplots to show the spread and identify outliers in the athlete performance data.
- Scatter plots to explore relationships between different variables, such as age and performance.

### Additional Insights

- **Gender Performance Disparity:** Historically, male participants tend to achieve faster race times compared to female participants.
- **Seasonal Difficulty Variation:** Analysis indicates that summer races are notably more challenging compared to races held in other seasons.
- **Optimal Season for Running:** Data suggests that spring emerges as the most favorable season for marathon running based on performance metrics.
